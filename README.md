- üõ°Ô∏è Anti-bot protection
- üêã Anti-whale measures
- üí∞ Tax system with multiple recipients
- üéÅ Airdrop mode
- üîí Secure and audited smart contracts
- üé® Modern and responsive UI
- üì± Mobile-friendly design

## Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have:

### 1. Development Tools
- **Git**: Version control system ([Download](https://git-scm.com/downloads))
  - Verify: `git --version`
- **Node.js**: v18 or later ([Download](https://nodejs.org))
  - Verify: `node --version`
- **Yarn**: Package manager ([Install](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/))
  - Verify: `yarn --version`
- **Code Editor**: VS Code recommended ([Download](https://code.visualstudio.com))
  - Recommended extensions: Solidity, ESLint, Prettier, GitLens

### 2. Web3 Knowledge
- Basic understanding of Binance Smart Chain and smart contracts
- BEP20 token standard
- Wallet management (MetaMask recommended)
- Gas fees and transactions (BNB)

### 3. Accounts & API Keys
- MetaMask wallet (or any Web3 wallet)
- BSC RPC provider (e.g., Ankr, QuickNode, Chainstack)
- BscScan account (for contract verification)

---

## Installation

### 1. Install Dependencies
```bash
yarn install
```

### 2. Environment Setup
Create a `.env` file in the root directory with the following variables:
```env
# Network selection
NEXT_PUBLIC_NETWORK=bscTestnet  # or bsc for mainnet

# RPC URLs
BSC_TESTNET_RPC_URL=your_bsc_testnet_rpc_url
BSC_RPC_URL=your_bsc_mainnet_rpc_url

# Token Factory
NEXT_PUBLIC_TOKEN_FACTORY_ADDRESS=your_token_factory_address
NEXT_PUBLIC_CREATION_FEE=0.01
NEXT_PUBLIC_FEE_RECIPIENT=your_fee_recipient_address

# BscScan
BSCSCAN_API_KEY=your_bscscan_api_key

# Wallet
PRIVATE_KEY=your_private_key
```

### 3. Get Required API Keys
- **BSC RPC URL**: (e.g., Ankr, QuickNode, Chainstack)
- **BscScan API Key**: [bscscan.com](https://bscscan.com) ‚Üí Create account ‚Üí API Keys section ‚Üí New API key

---

## Deployment

### 1. Compile Contracts
```bash
yarn hardhat compile
```

### 2. Deploy to BSC Testnet for testing
```bash
yarn hardhat run scripts/deploy.ts --network bsc
```
After successful deployment, you will see:
- TokenFactory contract address
- Creation fee
- Fee recipient address

## Verification
Verify your contract on BscScan:
```bash
yarn hardhat run scripts/verify.ts --network bsc
```

## Contract Verification & Testing

After verifying your contract, you can run the test-verification script to simulate token creation and contract verification:

```sh
yarn ts-node scripts/test-verification.ts
```

This script will deploy a test token, wait, and attempt BscScan verification automatically.

### 3. Deploy to Mainnet

Before deploying to mainnet, ensure you have:
1. Sufficient BNB in your wallet for deployment
2. Updated `.env` file with mainnet configuration
3. Tested thoroughly on testnet

To deploy to mainnet:
```bash
# 1. Update .env file with mainnet configuration
NEXT_PUBLIC_NETWORK=bsc
BSC_RPC_URL=your_bsc_mainnet_rpc_url
NEXT_PUBLIC_TOKEN_FACTORY_ADDRESS=your_mainnet_token_factory_address
BSCSCAN_API_KEY=your_mainnet_bscscan_api_key

# 2. Deploy TokenFactory to mainnet
yarn hardhat run scripts/deploy.ts --network bsc

# 3. Verify the contract on BscScan
yarn hardhat run scripts/verify.ts --network bsc
```

---

## Usage

### 1. Start Development Server
```bash
yarn dev
```

### 2. Create a Token
1. Connect your wallet
2. Fill in token details: Name, Symbol, Total Supply
3. Configure features: Anti-bot protection, Anti-whale measures, Tax system
4. Pay the creation fee (in BNB)
5. Deploy your token

### 3. Verify Your Token
After deployment once you run yarn ts-node scripts/test-verification.ts it will automatically verify all the other or future tokens which will be created.
